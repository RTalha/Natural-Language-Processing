Language

• Language is the development, acquisition, maintenance and use of 
 complex systems of communication.

• The prehistoric languages could only communicate the observations i.e., 
 having physical existence in time and space

• Over a period of time, the delicacy of languages allowed to have 
 abstract concepts and theories

• Just like anything else, language can also be used or abused, How?
Natural (Human) Language

• The method for human communication, either spoken or written. 
 It consist of the use of words in a structured and conventional way.

• It’s a system of communication that is used by a particular 
 community. 
• There are around 5000 to 7000 languages in the world (depending 
 on the arbitrary distinction between languages and their dialects.

Apart from spoken languages, there are sign languages, whistling, braille etc.
• Natural language is processed differently as it passes through 
 different parts of the human brain.
• Humans acquire language through social interactions in early 
 childhood and generally speak fluently by 3 years.

• The use of language is deeply entrenched in human culture. 
 Therefore, in addition to its strictly communicative uses, language 
 also has many social and cultural uses such as signifying group 
 identity, social stratification (social differentiation) as well social 
 grooming and entertainment.
Diversity of Natural Languages

• The complex structure of natural languages afford a much wider 
 range of expressions then any known system.

• It empowers humans to acquire the ability of a theory of other 
 minds and a shared intentionality.
The structure of languages evolve and diversify over time to serve 
specific communicative and social functions.

• Synchronic: Study of the state of a language at any given point in 
 history

• Diachronic: Differences among the states of language over decades 
 or centuries
Language Family

• The existing languages evolve and new languages are introduced.
• New languages usually are influenced by the dominant existing 
 languages.

• A group of languages that descend from a common ancestor is 
 known as a language family.

Culturally rich languages like Persian and Arabic can be observed to have 
footprints in many languages.
Linguistics

• Scientific or systematic study of language. Its science in the sense 
 that it scientifically studies the rules, systems and principles of 
 human language. 
• There are two objectives of linguistics or the scientific study of 
 language, that are;
   • To establish a theory of language and describe language in the light of that 
    theory.
   • Examining all forms of language and seeking scientific understanding of the 
    ways in which it is organized serve different needs and perform functions.
CS458 Natural Language Processing

Pre-Requisites:
• Prior knowledge of a Programming Language, ideally Java or 
 Python
• Basic understanding of Probability and Statistics
• Understanding of Algorithms and Data Structures
Class Ethics

Attendance:
• The university requires at least 80% attendance. Be in time and 
 watch your attendance to avoid end semester hassles. 

Late Submission of Assignments:
• Assignments after deadline will get 10% penalty after deadline for 
 first 3 days and will not be marked after that. Assignments will 
 have at least a week’s time. 
Quizzes:
• Quizzes will be announced a week before. There are no retake for 
 quizzes. Accommodate your other plans accordingly.

Project:
• The course project would have groups of two students each. The ideas 
 for projects would be discussed later in the course.

Opportunists:
• Keep track of your efforts and rewards. Please do not bother for favors 
 to stay afloat.  
Course Description

Natural language processing (NLP) addresses the fundamental questions at 
the intersection of human languages and computer science. It devises 
techniques that would help understand the basic language structure and 
processing it for various needs. This empowers users to get insights into 
observed human phenomena. It is an interdisciplinary course that helps to 
learn computers do useful things with human languages by mining high 
quality information from text and converting it to actionable knowledge. It 
may facilitate human life in different areas including business intelligence, 
information acquisition, social behavior analysis and decision making etc. 
The course introduces computational methods that can help linguistics 
explain language phenomena, inducing automatic discovery of different 
word senses and phrase structures. The course discusses statistical and 
probabilistic methods that have revolutionized NLP in the past decade.
Course Objectives


The students should achieve the following objectives from studying this 
course;
• Build models that would process a natural language and learn about its 
 structure
• Perform lexical, syntactic and semantic analysis on textual data
• Build models that would generate natural language
• Build models that would identify and extract useful information for text
• Have understanding of machine translation, comprehending natural 
 language and pragmatics
